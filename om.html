      <h2>Omkareshwar (IAST: Ōṃkārēśvar)</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Omkareshwar, a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva, is located in Mandhata,
        near Khandwa city in Khandwa district of the Indian state of Madhya
        Pradesh. It is one of the 12 revered Jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. It is
        on an island called Mandhata, near Khandwa city in the Narmada river at
        Khandwa district in Madhya Pradesh, India; the shape of the island is
        said to be like the Devanagari ॐ symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main temples of Shiva here, one to Omkareshwar (whose name
        means "Lord of Omkara or the Lord of the Om sound") located on the
        island and one to Mamleshwar (Amaleshwar) (whose name means "Immortal
        Lord" or "lord of the Immortals or Devas") located on the southern bank
        of the Narmada River on the mainland.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madhya Pradesh has two Jyotirlingas, the second one, Mahakaleshwar
        Jyotirlinga, is situated about 140 km north of Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga.
      </p>
      <h2>Jyotirlinga</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        According to the Shiv Mahapuran, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation)
        and Vishnu (the Hindu God of Protection and Care) had an argument in
        terms of supremacy of creation. To test them, Shiva pierced the three
        worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and
        Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find
        the end of the light in either direction. Brahma lied that he found out
        the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as the second
        pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in
        ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped until the end of eternity.
        The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva
        partly appears. The jyotirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva
        appeared as a fiery column of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally there were believed to be 64 jyotirlingas while 12 of them
        are considered to be very auspicious and holy. Each of the twelve
        jyotirlinga sites takes the name of the presiding deity each considered
        a different manifestation of Shiva. At all of these sites, the primary
        image is lingam representing the beginningless and endless Stambha
        pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva.
      </p>
      <div class="c">
        The twelve jyotirlingas are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at
        Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh,
        Omkareshwar in Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, in
        Uttarakhand state, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in
        Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar near Nashik in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath
        Temple, Vaidyanath in Jharkhand, Nageshwar at Dwarika in Gujarat,
        Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, and Grishneshwar near Aurangabad,
        Maharashtra in Maharashtra.

      <h2>Legends and History</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        As per Hindu legend, Vindhya, the deity controlling the Vindhyachal
        mountain range was worshipping Shiva to propitiate himself from the sins committed. He c
        reated a sacred geometrical diagram and a Lingam made of sand and clay. Shiva was 
        pleased with the worship and believed to have appeared in two forms, namely Omkareshwar
         and Amaleswara. Since the mud mound appeared in the form of Om, the island came to be known
          as Omkareswar. There is a shrine for Parvati and Ganapati in the temple
      </p>
      <p>
        The second story relates to Mandhata and his son's penance. King Mandhata of Ikshvaku clan (an ancestor of Ram
        ) worshipped Shiva here until the Lord manifested himself as a Jyotirlinga. Some scholars also narrate the story 
        about Mandhata's sons-Ambarish and Muchukunda, who had practiced severe penance and austerities here and pleased Shiva.
         Because of this, the mountain is named Mandhata.
      </p><br>
      <p>Adi Shankara's Cave – Omkareshwar is said to be the place where Adi Sankara met his guru Govinda Bhagavatpada in a cave. This cave
         can be found even today just below the Shiva temple where an image of Adi Shankara has been installed</p>
      <br><h2>Location</h2><hr> <br>
      <p>It is situated in the Mandhata city (also known as Omkareshwar) in Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh state in India. It is about 
        16 km from Barwaha in Madhya Pradesh. Omkareshwar is formed by the sacred river Narmada. This is one of the most sacred rivers in
        India and is now home to one of the world's biggest dam projects. The temple is situated on Mandhata or Shivpuri island on the banks of Narmada and Kaveri river
        (a tributary of Narmada). The island is 4 KM long and 2.6 km2 (2,600,000 m2) in area and can be approached by boats and bridge</p><br><Br>
